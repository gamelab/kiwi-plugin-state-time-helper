# Description

The State Time Helper adds clocks and tween managers to the state itself. This is useful for two reasons: stability and diversity.

State-based time functions are highly stable. If you create a time function, such as a `Timer` or `Tween`, use of game-based services such as `game.tweens` or `game.time.clock` may result in instability. This is because game-based services continue to run after the state has been destroyed, and may attempt to access destroyed data, resulting in exceptions and errors. State-based time services only run within the state, avoiding these common errors.

The helper can create several time systems in parallel. These allow you to decouple behaviours from a single control structure. For example, by default the helper creates a "ui" and a "world" time service. You could pause the "world" clock to quickly stop world objects moving, and still run the "ui" service to animate menu elements.

# Usage

To load the State Time Helper plugin, simply include the plugin in your KiwiJS game. See below for details.

To add the plugin to a state, simply create a `Kiwi.Plugins.StateTimeHelper.Component` object during the `create` method. It will register itself.

Consult the `examples/` folder for a functional example.

## Including the Plugin

Add the plugin from the `build/` folder to your html file. Ensure you load it after the KiwiJS library:

```html
<script src="js/libs/kiwi.js"></script>
<script src="../build/state-time-helper-1.0.0.js"></script>
```

Include the plugin in your game options:

```js
var gameOptions = {
		plugins: [ "StateTimeHelper" ]
	};

var game = new Kiwi.Game( null, "game", null, gameOptions );
```

## Using the Helper

In your game state, create the helper component:

```js
this.timeHelper = new Kiwi.Plugins.StateTimeHelper.Component( {
	owner: this
} );
```

This will create the following objects on the game state:

* `this.clocks`
* `this.tweens`

These objects contain, respectively, clocks and tween managers. These are paired: all tween managers have a related clock by the same name. Adjusting the clock will adjust the behaviour of the associated tween manager.

By default, the time helper will create two pairs of `Clock` and `TweenManager` objects: `ui` and `world`. You may use these keys to access both clocks and tweens from the respective containers. For example, `this.clocks.ui.setTimeout()` or `this.tweens.world.create()`.

You may customise the clocks and tweens by specifying them during creation (overriding defaults), or by creating them afterwards.

```js
// Create custom keys
this.timeHelper = new Kiwi.Plugins.StateTimeHelper.Component( {
	owner: this,
	keys: [ "timestream1", "timestream2", "timestream3" ]
} );

// Add keys
this.timeHelper.create( "timestream4" );
```

You may access certain properties of all clocks or tween managers at once using the methods `getOnAllClocks`, `getOnAllTweens`, `setOnAllClocks`, `setOnAllTweens`, `runOnAllClocks`, and `runOnAllTweens`. For example:

```js
// Return an array of the names of all tween managers, e.g. [ "ui", "world" ]
Kiwi.Log.log( this.timeHelper.getOnAllTweens( "name") );

// Set the time scale on all clocks:
this.timeHelper.setOnAllClocks( "timeScale", 0.5 );

// Pause all clocks:
this.timeHelper.runOnAllClocks( "pause" );
```

Note that you cannot run all methods in this way. For example, you need to provide unique identifiers when creating tweens, so you cannot `runOnAllTweens( "create" )` to quickly animate all objects at once. You must instead use `for ( var i in this.tweens ) { this.tweens[ i ].create(); }` or similar patterns.
